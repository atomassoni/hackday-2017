This is a starter project for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) BLE projects.

It reads all BLE device advertisments, connects to a device, and gets data from the device. The code is somewhat specific to the hardware from the IoT Fuse Hackday 2017 IoT Workshop, but it's a starting point for a working BLE app using Ionic. 

Please install Ionic using the [Introduction to Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/) documentation. Verify that you can build a project with the starter app. If you have git installed you can then clone this repo and run the project on your own device.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomassoni/hackday-2017.git
